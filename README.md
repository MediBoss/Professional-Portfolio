This repository contains a list of my main projects to showcase my software engineering skills.

### 1. <a href = "https://github.com/MediBoss/TrackHub" >TrackHub </a>

TrackHub is an inventoy - based application that provides the client with key informations of their products based on the given inputs. Instead of writting a list of all of the business' products on a notebook and do the calculations physically, TrackHub does all those tasks for you!
