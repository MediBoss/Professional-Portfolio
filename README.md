This repository contains a list of my main projects to showcase my software engineering skills.

### 1. <a href = "https://github.com/MediBoss/TrackHub" >TrackHub </a> 

TrackHub is an inventoy - based application that provides the client with key informations of their products based on the given inputs. Instead of writting a list of all of the business' products on a notebook and do the calculations physically, TrackHub does all those tasks for you!

### 2. <a href = "https://github.com/MediBoss/SIBS" >S.I.B.S</a> 
Super Intelligent Book Summarizer, or SIBS, is a web application (or terminal/command-line application)that concisely and accuratly summarizes the user's book or article at any given length.I am currenlty building it to run on the Terminal with local files but then will build it as a web app with html,css,and Flask for the backend.
